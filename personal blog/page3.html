          <p><strong>PROJECT CONTENT</strong><br><br>The local community library serves as our client for this project. To enable libraries to continue to be a hub for their local communities, we will be looking at how they can improve resources they provide in the areas of technology and workplace readiness. We will use different methods of research to determine competitors, to gather quantitative and qualitative information from subject matter experts and users, and begin to formulate the persona and problem our design will target.
          <br><br><br><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT</strong><br><br>The job market has significantly changed due to technological advances and the skill sets required for the job market today and our user looking to the library to meet this need for themselves and local communities.
          <br><br><i><q>As a user who is trying to change careers, I need to learn how to use Google Drive products, utilize job search engines, find assistance with cover letters and resumes, build a network with business professionals, and find a professional work space that provides workshops and seminars that are free and accessible to utilize at my own pace.</q></i>
          <br><br><br><strong>DESIGN APPROACH</strong><br><br>
          <p>Our main goal was to develop a solution to support public libraries in continuing to be a hub for their local communities while improving resources in the areas of technology and workplace readiness. Utilizing the Design Thinking we have begun with understanding Public Library needs and user goals. Findings supported our assumptions on possible solutions for the product’s core features. Upon conducting Subject Matter Expert interviews and initial research we have determined that the current adult literacy and tech skills have room for improvement. The National Assessment of Adult Literacy established that 14% of adults in America rated as “below basic” and only 29% as “basic” (NCES, 2003). Our interviewees established that they have the first hand experience with these results in adult technology and digital skills. Additionally, we’ve found how important to create a product with mobile and desktop services, to accommodate users with access to limited mobile or desktop devices. Designing a product that could essentially help users to interact with professionals virtually and in-person to learn more about specific details of the chosen field or job could be extremely helpful and crucial for users to gain knowledge and boost their motivation toward achieving their goals. There were many different options for our team to consider for creating a competitive product that could have the potential to improve user experiences and helps libraries create more inclusive digital communities <br>
          <p>Networking Lab is a mobile app that offers users fascinating opportunities to effectively utilize local public library services. The product we have designed as a team is a virtual networking application that will provide the user with access to library experts and local business professionals in a wide array of fields to help the user with their career goals.</p>
